## Sugar Beet Plant Growth Stage Detection (Computer Vision)

Sugar Beet Plant Growth Stage Detection (Computer Vision)
Welcome to the Sugar Beet Plant Growth Stage Detection project. This open source project utilizes Computer Vision to automate the detection of growth stages of Sugar Beet plants. It aims to assist farmers and agronomists in making more informed decisions about crop management, ultimately improving yield and sustainability.

**Introduction**
Sugar beet, an important commercial crop, has specific growth stages. Understanding these stages is crucial for efficient crop management. This project uses Computer Vision to automate the process of detecting these growth stages. Our model has been trained on a diverse set of images and can accurately identify different growth stages, offering a practical tool for farmers and researchers.
